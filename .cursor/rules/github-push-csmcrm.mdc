# GitHub Push Target

For this project, **all pushes to GitHub go to the `csmcrm` remote** unless the user explicitly says otherwise.

- **Default push**: Use `git push csmcrm main` (or the current branch) when pushing to GitHub.
- **Do not** use `git push origin main` for this project — `origin` points to a different repo (mine_dont_touch).
- If the user specifies a different remote or repo, follow their instruction instead.

This project’s primary GitHub repo is **csmcrm** (e.g. `https://github.com/bennyg83/csmcrm.git`).
